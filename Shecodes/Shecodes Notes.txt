HOW TO GET COLOR PALETTES AND GRADIENTS FROM SHECODES
>>shecodes.io/palettes
>>shecodes.io/gradients

html- Elements
<h1> meams heading 1, it highlights the text in bold
</h1> this is to close it, to show that, thats it for heading one 
there is also h2-6
<p> and </p> for a paragraph
e.g 
<p>
  creatires of the night
</p>

this would make "creatures og the night" to be in paragraph 
<strong> to make it bold
<em> (emphasis)to make it italic
NB; a;ways remember to close "/" or the comp wont know when to stop.
<br> is used to make a new line
its added at the end of the very line ur in, meaning you would be like
of the night <br>
its a self closing type, so you dont have to worry about closing cuz well
its just a new line, you dont hv to close a new line.
but for visual references developers like to write it as <br />

you can add multiple lines 
e.g
of the night
<br />
<br />
<br />
e.t.c


another self closing one is <hr> also known as <hr />
what it does it to create a horizoltal line that would run across the whole page.
for an unordered list;

<ul>
  <li>
    SheCodes Basics
  </li>
  <li>
    SheCodes Plus
  </li>
  <li>
    SheCodes Responsive
  </li>
  <li>
    SheCodes React
  </li>
</ul>

it would create
. shecones workshop
. shecodes+
etc 
nb; the "." represent the bullet point that would be created.

to male an ordered list we replace the <ul> and </ul> by <ol> and </ol>

it changeds the bullet points to numbers 
1.
2.
3.

like that.



naturally, you might want to go ahead of urself and decide to just keep using <br> 
to seperate it while listing but google wont recognize it.

html- Attributes

these are usefule for us to give the comp extra information to the browser, so that it knows what it has to do with our HTML code

now, let us talk qabout how to buld a link
we would have to use <a> & </a>

if we just use
<a>
shecodes
</a>

it would creat that path shit, showung that it is a link but when you click on it, it wouldnt know where to go
so that means, we would have to add a URL

so the url to shecodes is shecodes.io

that is were ' href="" ' comes in (hyper link reference)

this where we would add the link
i.e 
<a href="https://shecodes.io">
shecodes
</a>
now, practically,now that the link is set, if we click the link, the stuff would load on that very tab, so...to change that, we can add ' target="_blank"
now it would open on a different tab.
i.e 
<a href="https://shecodes.io" target="_blank">



now lets assume we wanna add an image

i.e 
<img> it is a self closing element bcos it doesnt hv a text <img />

as the first one, we would need to tell the browser where to go

with the ' src="" ' (source)

i.e 
<img src="the link to the picture(from online)" />

npw, we can adjust the side of the imagine using 'width="the size as numbers (300,500)" ' which adjusts the size of the pixels 

i.e
<img src="the link to the picture(from online)" width="300" />

In HTML/javascript "or" is written as ||
"and" is written as &&
There are different ways to add ".toLowerCase();" to code
e.g 
<script>
      let country = prompt("What country are you from?");

      if (country === "portugal" || country === "brazil") {
        alert("You speak Portuguese!");
      } else {
        alert("You don't speak Portuguese!");
      }
    </script>

We add it by 
1. <script>
      let country = prompt("What country are you from?");

      if (country.toLowerCase() === "portugal" || country.toLowerCase() === "brazil") {
        alert("You speak Portuguese!");
      } else {
        alert("You don't speak Portuguese!");
      }
    </script>
2. <script>
      let country = prompt("What country are you from?");
       country = country.toLowerCase();
      if (country === "portugal" || country === "brazil") {
        alert("You speak Portuguese!");
      } else {
        alert("You don't speak Portuguese!");
      }
    </script>
3. <script>
      let country = prompt("What country are you from?").toLowerCase();

      if (country === "portugal" || country === "brazil") {
        alert("You speak Portuguese!");
      } else {
        alert("You don't speak Portuguese!");
      }
    </script>
NB: it helps to work with lower case(in portugal and brazil) to help the instance for country to be true(in lowercase)
