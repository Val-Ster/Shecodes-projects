        Thereâ€™s something magical about books that pull you into new worlds, and
        Exodus is no exception. In a future where technology has reshaped the
        world, Exodus tells the story of Martin Wesley, a tech mogul who, along
        with his adopted daughters, must survive an apocalyptic nightmare caused
        by his own creation. Filled with gripping fantasy, tragedy, technology,
        action and fulfillment, Exodus takes you on a journey where humanityâ€™s
        greatest advancements become its greatest threats. Will Martin and his
        daughters be able to undo the damage and save the world? Or will
        monsters from another realm make survival impossible? Stay tuned for the
        release of Exodusâ€”a tale of love, loss, and redemption in a world gone
        wrong.
